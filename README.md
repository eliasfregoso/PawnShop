Resources: 
While we are building up an empire that will sell billions of dollars, open source tools will server us in the meantime: 

this link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y8lArmCWT0Wwvyk5a7WZDsDSK1lQmqPz?usp=drive_link) gives us access to a google Drive folder that inlcudes:

* IDE's (VsCode / Spyder)
* python 3.11.5 installation executable
* OCR engines (tesseract)
* Git utilities
* PDF books and resources 
  
We believe that learning makes us better, so we added some resources were one can get familiarized with the languages and tools that we intend to use. 

Its not a mandatory checklist but a resource hub. 

In the meantime thats all we need to know... Happy Trails...
